  bio:
    "I am an Subject Matter Expert Software Engineer with over two decades of experience designing and building software in the intelligence community. I love to make web applications that are polished, standards based, and user friendly. While I prefer to work on the front end, my Computer Science background lends well when I need to get my hands dirty on the back end of systems. These skills have played a large part in the launches of 8 major web applications, four of them flagship level.",
